A game application I developed as a school project.
Several features were added over the course of the class.

1.RULES
  The game is a race between the user and computer to 100. 
  Each turn, the player or computer will roll two dice to accumulate a score that will be added to their respective total scores.
  The player can continue to roll up until they hit the "Hold" button. 
  However, if a single 1 is rolled, the turn score resets to 0 and the turn ends. 
  If double 1s are rolled, the total score is set to 0 and the turn ends.   
  The computer is programmed to take three turns based on a countdown timer. The rules about rolling 1s applies to the computer for each tick.
